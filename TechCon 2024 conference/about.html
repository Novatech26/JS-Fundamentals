      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        TechCon was founded in 2010 as a small meetup for developers and technologists passionate 
        about emerging technologies. What began as a modest community event has since evolved 
        into a global tech summit, uniting thousands of innovators across sectors to explore the future of technology.
        Over the years, TechCon expanded its focus from grassroots coding meetups to high-impact sessions on AI, blockchain, 
        fintech, and digital policy. The event has helped shape digital transformation in Africa and beyond, building bridges 
        between startups, governments, academia, and industry leaders.
        Today, TechCon is known not just for its thought leadership and hands-on workshops, but also for empowering participants
        to build meaningful connections and bring change to their communities through technology.
